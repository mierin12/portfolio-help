title: Booking management fees
---

In addition to transaction fees, some brokers charge management fees, typically an annual percentage of the portfolioâ€™s value. In such cases, the broker deducts these fees by selling a small portion of your shares, reducing the total number you own.

This is essentially a sell transaction followed by a fee transaction. These can be booked in a single transaction through an [*Outbound Delivery*](../reference/transaction/delivery.md) where the shares are sold and the fees are applied to the sold value within the same transaction. This results in a **total outbound delivery amount of 0**.

To accurately book those fees, it is important that your broker details the number of sold shares.

!!! Note
    This can be done in an [*Outbound Delivery*](../reference/transaction/delivery.md) and not in a [*Sell*](../reference/transaction/buy-sell.md) as Sell transaction in Portfolio Performance can not have a final null value.

	This is with this methodology that fees on securities in French *assurances-vies* can be booked.

### Example
In this example, let's consider that 0.5671 shares of `stock-A` are owned through a broker applying an annual 0.75 % management fees, taken 4 times a year : 0.75 % / 4 = 0.1875 % fees applied each quarter, on December 19, March 18, June 17 and Septembre 18.

The first quaterly fees on `stock-A` consist in a sell of `0.75/100/4 * 0.5671 = 0.001` shares, whose sold value is taken as fees.
And again on March 18 :
`0.75/100/4 * 0.5661 = 0.001` shares are sold by the broker and the sold value is taken as fees. Same for the other dates.

The [Performance Chart](../reference/view/reports/performance/performance-chart.md) illustrates the impact of these fees : compared to the price performance of `stock-A`, our `stock-A` performance is 0.75 % lower than its benchmark over a year.

### Second method
This could also be done by separating the Sell and the Fee transactions by using:

1. First a [*Sell*](../reference/transaction/buy-sell.md) transaction
2. Second a [*Fees*](../reference/transaction/fees-taxes.md) transaction on the cash account, related to the sold security.

but this creates two transactions and forces to use a cash account.
